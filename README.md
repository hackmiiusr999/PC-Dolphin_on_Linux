# PC-Dolphin_on_Linux

If you want to download Just click & download the install.sh file.

once you placed it in your /home/example/

run this command: ~/install.sh

it will install dolphin and everything else

Note: If your Doing this on a chromebook; & Your "Leagal" Games are on a drive, go into your

/mnt/chromeos/removable/

if you don't find anything, Make sure your folder is shared with linux by going to your 
drive then, go to the 3 dots and click "share with linux" or something, then mount it

if you still have truble mounting it, then its the drives name.

for example

/mnt/chromeos/removable/USB Drive

that won't work

but if you try: /mnt/chromeos/removable/'USB Drive'

it may work better than before.
